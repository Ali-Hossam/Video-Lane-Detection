# **Lane Detection**

## TO-DO
1. ~~Perspective transformation~~
2. ~~Change the order of the preprocessing steps to be (Crop, Perspective Transformation - Edge detection (Sobel or canny), Morphological operations)~~
3. ~~Integrate Hough~~ and sliding window algorithm
4. Check real-time performance
5. Test on different road videos
6. **UI**

## Problems
1. Accuracy of Hough is low, also it is slow
2.
